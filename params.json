{"name":"TuxRacerVR","tagline":"Extreme Tux Racer 0.6 with Oculus Rift support.","body":"# [Extreme Tuxracer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/extremetuxracer/) VR \r\n\r\nThe open source downhill winter game with Oculus Rift support!  Please have patience and read the following to get it running acceptably (low latency).  WARNING: A decent gaming graphics card is necessary. Integrated graphics hardware, eg. most laptops, won't be fast enough.\r\n\r\n![TuxRacerVR Logo](http://jdtaylor.org/oculus_share_primary_evening.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n![TuxRacerVR Screenshot](https://d11g5bl75h7gks.cloudfront.net/shareuploads/apps/1431560364519m4cifz85mi/screens/1429606941987m8gjnka9k9_1429607620160.jpg)\r\n\r\nWatch on Youtube:\r\n\r\n[![TuxRacerVR Youtube Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/sc76iido7fU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc76iido7fU)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Windows:\r\n* [TuxRacerVR_v0.63.zip](https://github.com/jdtaylor/tuxracer-vr/releases/download/v0.63/TuxRacerVR_v0.63.zip)\r\n* Make sure the Oculus runtime is installed and running in either extended or direct-to-rift mode.\r\n* Download, unzip, and run TuxRacerVR.exe from the extracted directory.\r\n* If in extended mode, use F2 or F9 key to toggle between the Rift and back.  Direct-to-rift should \"Just Work\" (no need for F9 key) and mirror to both displays.\r\n* See config/options.txt for performance tweaks if needed (see below).\r\n\r\n### Linux:\r\n* [TuxRacerVR_v0.64_linux64.zip](https://github.com/jdtaylor/tuxracer-vr/releases/download/v0.64/TuxRacerVR_v0.64_linux64.zip)\r\n* Make sure the Oculus runtime is installed and running and don't rotate dk2.\r\n* Download, unzip, and run ./TuxRacerVR from the extracted directory.\r\n * If you get this: \"Error: [Context] Unable to obtain x11 visual from context\", PLEASE report back if this helps:\r\n  * OVR_FBCONFIG_OVERRIDE=1 ./TuxRacerVR\r\n* Use F2 or F9 key to toggle between the Rift and back.\r\n* See config/options.txt for performance tweaks if needed (see below).\r\n\r\n### OSX:\r\n* It should compile from source though I havn't tried yet. \r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\nControls are all based on head movements.\r\n* Look at gui components and wait for a second to select them.\r\n* Lean left/right to control Tux's direction down the course.\r\n* Lean back to brake and slow down.\r\n* Protips:\r\n  * Don't paddle or brake on ice; Slide for more speed (not easy).\r\n  * Look down and back up to get more air during a jump.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n* F2 or F9 toggles the window to the Rift and back (ONLY for extended mode).\r\n* SPACE: recenter the view to the current HMD orientation.\r\n* Up/Down arrows change the distance behind tux.\r\n* Right/Left: change the angle above/behind tux.\r\n* h: cycle through different modes of heads up display. \r\n * hud cycles: Off -> World Relative -> FPS toggle -> Stuck to Face -> Off\r\n* r: reset player location if stuck somewhere on the course.\r\n* w/s: increase/decrease IPD.\r\n* a/d: increase/decrease player speed.\r\n* '1,2,3,4' flip between preset camera positions.\r\n* F3-F8 toggles display of elements in the course.\r\n* ESC to go back a screen or quit the game.\r\n* Delete the file config/options.txt to regenerate w/ defaults.\r\n\r\n### Compile from source:\r\n* Dependencies: sdl2 sdl2-mixer sdl2-image ftgl freetype glew git g++\r\n * apt-get install git libsdl2-dev libftgl-dev libftgl2 libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libvorbis-dev libjpeg8-dev libpng-dev libsmpeg-dev chrpath\r\n * optional but recommended for changes to configure.ac: autotools-dev libltdl-dev automake autoconf\r\n * For older debian (squeeze or wheezy) follow: http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/\r\n   * apt-get -t wheezy-backports install \"libsdl2-dev\"\r\n   * Other libs need to be compiled manually if not in your distro already: sdl2-mixer sdl2-image\r\n* Download the oculus rift sdk 0.4.4 (0.5 not supported yet), extract somewhere, and compile it:\r\n * https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/#version=pc-0.4.4-beta\r\n* Download and compile tuxracer vr:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nsudo apt-get install git\r\ngit clone https://github.com/jdtaylor/tuxracer-vr.git\r\nexport OVR_ROOT=\"/path/to/your/compiled/oculus/ovr_sdk_linux_0.4.4\"\r\nexport CXXFLAGS=\"-Ofast -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native\" \r\ncd tuxracer-vr\r\n./configure\r\nmake \r\nsrc/etr\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* On Linux the Oculus SDK only supports extended mode.. whether using Xinerama or as separate displays via the DISPLAY environment variable.\r\n* Please make sure your oculusd or ovrd service is running and issue src/etr from the root build directory.\r\n* Use F2 or F9 key to toggle to the rift and back.\r\n* If you get poor <75 fps performance, try disabling vsync in the configuration file.  In the ~/.etr/options file change '[no_vsync] 0' to '[no_vsync] 1'\r\n* Sometimes if the rift is turned off and back on while Xorg is running, judder starts and I havn't found a way to make it go away without an X shutdown and restart w/ the Rift on.\r\n* I've seen good results with the following in ~/.etr/options for the open source Radeon driver.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[fullscreen] 0\r\n[detail_level] 1\r\n[forward_clip_distance] 80\r\n[backward_clip_distance] 30\r\n[tree_detail_distance] 30\r\n[tux_sphere_divisions] 2\r\n[tux_shadow_sphere_div] 1\r\n[course_detail_level] 75\r\n[full_skybox] 1\r\n[no_skybox] 0\r\n[no_vsync] 0\r\n[no_prediction] 0\r\n[no_timewarp] 0\r\n[no_timewarp_spinwaits] 0\r\n[no_hq_distortion] 1\r\n[no_compute_shader] 1\r\n[no_restore] 0\r\n[use_fxaa] 1\r\n[ipd_multiplier] 1\r\n[player_frict_speed] 11\r\n[camera_distance] 3.5\r\n[camera_angle] -26\r\n[fly_amount] 30\r\n[dire_straits_tux] 1\r\n[console_dump] 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to lose your lunch.. accidentally set 'player_frict_speed' to something over 120.\r\n\r\n## Things Needing Attention\r\n* I've only been testing with open source radeon drivers.  Please let me know if other cards/drivers work or not.\r\n* Optimization is needed for higher detail levels, track marks, ice env maps, snow.\r\n* Fog planes vary in brightness with hmd pitch. \r\n* There's no fog planes behind the player.. only down the course.\r\n* If it fails to start with: 'Error: [Context] Unable to obtain x11 visual from context'\r\n * Quick fix: OVR_FBCONFIG_OVERRIDE=1 ./TuxRacerVR\r\n * Occurs when using the xf86-video-ati open source radeon driver.
